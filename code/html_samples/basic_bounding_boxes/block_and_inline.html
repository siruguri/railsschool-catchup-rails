  <body>
    <div style="border: 5px solid red">
      This is red box 1, with a sub-box in <i style="border: 5px solid green">green</i>. Notice how its width extends to the width of its parent container.
    </div>
    <div style="border: 5px solid red">
      This is red box 1 again, with <span style="font-style: italic; border: 5px solid green">a green sub-box</span>. Notice how its width extends to the width of its parent container.
    </div>
    <div style="border: 5px solid red">
      This is red box, a third time, with <div style="font-style: italic; border: 5px solid green">a green sub-box</div>. Notice how its width extends to the width of its parent container.
    </div>
    <div style="border: 5px solid blue">
      This is a box in blue with a <ul style="border: 5px solid green">green element in it (but see how the green element stacks down now because it's encased in a block-level ul)</ul>. Notice how it "stacks down" below its previous sibling.
    </div>
