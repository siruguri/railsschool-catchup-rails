# Introduction

This set of lessons walks beginners through the basics of web programming, using the Ruby on Rails framework (hereinafter referred to as _RoR_). It assumes some understanding of programming basics, and some familiarity with either Ruby syntax (ideally) or with the syntax of similar, interpreted, languages, like Perl, Python or PHP.

These lessons will focus entirely on the design patterns and web
programming ideas that are supported by RoR. In particular, these
lessons will only touch lightly on aspects that are not central to RoR
like scalability, security, good design patterns in programming,
database optimization and so on. 

RoR facilitates the development of web applications that are
optimized, highly scalable and secure, but at its heart, it's meant,
more than anything else, to help you design the basic logic of your
application easily, and that's what we'll be exploring.
