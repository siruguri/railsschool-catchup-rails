# Forms Basics

By default, Rails supplies you with a DSL for easily constructing HTML forms. There are [a plethora of helper functions that you can use in views to generate form elements](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html). 

More specifically, the `form_for` method takes an instance of a model class as an argument, and provides a library of methods that correspond to the various form input types in HTML, like `textarea`, `checkbox` and so on.
