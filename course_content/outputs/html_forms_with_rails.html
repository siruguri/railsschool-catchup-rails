<h1 id="toc_0">Built-in Forms</h1>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll probably want to do after creating a few models is play around with HTML forms to update them. </p>

<p>Rails comes with a built-in set of methods that make it easy to create forms. The <code>scaffold</code> generation also gives you a basic form for each model you created, for the <em>create</em> and <em>edit</em> actions.</p>

<li>Try using the Formtastic gem instead.</li>
<li>Read about aspects of forms:

<ul>
<li>Why does Rails create a label by default for all form elements? Hint: it has <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3142884/regarding-the-html-labels-for-property">something to do with accessibility</a>.</li>
<li>Why won&rsquo;t Rails use <code>method=put</code> when updating a form? Hint: it has something to do with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11797270/ruby-on-rails-put-method-on-update-ajax">browser support for the <code>PUT</code> method</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
