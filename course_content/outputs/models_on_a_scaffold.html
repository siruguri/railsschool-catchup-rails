<h1 id="toc_0">The Bare Bones of Rails</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">Scaffolds and Skeletons</h2>

<p>Putting all the pieces of a model - creation, display, deleting - by yourself is a tedious process. So Rails makes it easy for you by giving you a command called <code>rails generate</code></p>
<div class=mycode>
rails&nbsp;generate&nbsp;scaffold&nbsp;Post&nbsp;body:string&nbsp;posted_on:datetime<br/>
<span class='comment'>#&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;type&nbsp;in&nbsp;'g'&nbsp;instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;'generate',&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;shortcut</span>
</div>

<p>The <code>rails generate scaffold</code> command does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a model that has the attributes with the data types specified in the <code>rails generate</code> command

<ul>
<li>Also, create the <em>database migration</em> needed to capture this in your database</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Generate views for the following:

<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>reate: Create an instance</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>ead: View an individual instance or a list of all instances</li>
<li><strong>U</strong>pdate: Edit an instance, and</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>elete: Yep, delete an instance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Generate the controllers corresponding to these views</li>
<li>Create a set of <em>RESTful</em> routes to match a set of paths (with corresponding actions) to the actions created for this model, using the <code>resources</code> method in the <code>routes.rb</code> file</li>
</ul>

<p>Those four actions constitute the Four Horsemen of the RESTful Apocalypse (to be fanciful about it) - they are typically referred to as the <strong>CRUD</strong> actions for a RESTful resource. Many tricks in Rails magic make it easy to build these RESTful actions.</p>

<p>You can also perform these steps individually through <code>rails generate</code> (except for the addition of the route set, which you&rsquo;d have to do via your editor), by running them in this order:</p>
<div class=mycode>
rails&nbsp;generate&nbsp;model&nbsp;Post&nbsp;body:string&nbsp;posted_on:datetime<br/>
rails&nbsp;generate&nbsp;controller&nbsp;Post&nbsp;<span class='comment'>#&nbsp;This&nbsp;generates&nbsp;the&nbsp;views&nbsp;too.</span>
</div>

<p>When you use scaffolding, Rails magic works in some very specific ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The model is named assuming the model name is in a <em>singular</em> form, and is capitalized because it&rsquo;s a Ruby class name, which have to be capitalized.

<ul>
<li><strong>But</strong>: the corresponding database table is named in the <em>plural</em> form, and starts with a lowercase letter. So the name of the table for our <code>Post</code> model above, in the database, is <code>posts</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The controller is capitalized too, but it&rsquo;s named using the <em>plural</em> form of the model name. So the name of the controller created by <code>rails generate scaffold</code> is <code>PostsController</code> (note the plural.)</li>
<li>The views are in a folder that&rsquo;s named by the plural form - so our views for the <code>Post</code> model are in the folder <code>app/views/posts</code></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_2">Migration: Setting Up Your Database</h1>

<p>But here&rsquo;s one thing that the <code>rails generate scaffold</code> magic won&rsquo;t do
- it won&rsquo;t set up your database for you. That you have to do yourself,
with the <code>rake</code> executable.<code>rake</code> comes with your Rails
installation. It can be asked to perform <em>tasks</em>, and one of those
tasks is to set up your database tables. That task is called
<code>db:migrate</code>:</p>
<div class=mycode>
rake&nbsp;db:migrate
</div>

<h2 id="toc_3">Playing Around With Your Models</h2>

<p>In the next section, we&rsquo;ll explore the <em>Rails Console</em>: now that you have a database that can accomodate your models&#39; data, let&rsquo;s create some instances.</p>

<h1 id="toc_4">Advanced Topics</h1>

<p>Here are some more topics you can read once you&rsquo;ve become comfortable with the above material:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the other data types you can create? 

<ul>
<li>Look into how the <code>text</code> datatype is different from the <code>string</code> datatype.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the other ways of writing view files?

<ul>
<li>Look into what HAML is.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
